### BackEnd

The backEnd for this project was created using [JsonServer](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#paginate). BackEnd is not the focus of the practice, but the frontEnd with Angular.
Inside BackEnd directory run `npm start` to start.

### Development FrontEnd server

Run `npm start` for a dev server, inside a frontEnd directory. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
